# Expense Tracker

This is a simple web application built with React that helps you track your expenses. You can add new expenses and filter the existing data.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you can use the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Features

### Add new expense

To add a new expense, click on the "Add New Expense" button and fill in the form. The app will validate the input and add the new expense to the list.

### Filter expenses

You can filter the expenses based on year using the dropdown menu. The app will update the list to show only the expenses from the selected year.

## Learn More

To learn more about React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Troubleshooting

If `npm run build` fails to minify, please see the [troubleshooting guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify) for more information.
